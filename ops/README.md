# Tempo operations

CI builds one image per commit, publishes `ghcr.io/tempo-co/tempo-{api,web}:pr-<n>` for every same-repo PR, and tags `:main` after tests pass on `main`. `ops/deploy.sh` deploys those images to both targets: it resolves tags to digests, recreates only API and web, waits for health, and restores the previous images if the new ones are unhealthy. Database migrations are not rolled back.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `deploy.sh` | Deploy script for both targets |
| `targets/{production,staging}.env` | Non-secret per-target settings |
| `backup.sh` | Validated `pg_dump`, scheduled and pre-deploy |
| `install.sh` | Copies the above to the host |
| `runtime-image-smoke.js` | Runtime image check run by the `Dockerfile` |
| `ghcr-retention.sh` | Weekly GHCR cleanup (`.github/workflows/ghcr-retention.yml`, also used by tempo-web): keeps `main`, open PRs' `pr-<n>` and anything newer than 30 days. Also keeps the last 5 `main` images as rollback targets. Dry run until the repo variable `GHCR_RETENTION_DELETE=true`; GitHub pauses scheduled workflows after 60 days without repo activity |
| `systemd/` | Production deploy and backup timers (installed by `install.sh`); staging Docker daemon (user unit, installed once by hand) |
| `staging/` | Staging Compose file, env template, database refresh |

## Production

`tempo-deploy-production.timer` runs `deploy.sh production` every 5 minutes and deploys `:main`. Before any API image change it takes a validated backup into `/var/lib/tempo-deploy/pre-deploy-backups` (newest 5 kept); a failed backup cancels the deploy. Images that fail to deploy are skipped until `:main` moves.

```bash
journalctl -u tempo-deploy-production.service -n 50   # what happened
cat /var/lib/tempo-deploy/deployed.env                # what is deployed
```

`tempo-backup.timer` runs `backup.sh` nightly at 03:30 into `~/backups/tempo` (newest 14 timestamped archives kept; manual `tempo-pre-*.dump` files are never pruned). Staging refreshes from these archives.

After changing anything in `ops/` or `docker-compose.production.yml`, install from a clean `main` checkout:

```bash
git fetch && git checkout --detach origin/main
sudo ops/install.sh production
```

Production secrets live in `/etc/tempo/production.env` (mode 600), outside the repository. Email goes through authenticated Gmail SMTP (`smtp.gmail.com:587`, STARTTLS required).

### Network boundary

PostgreSQL, Redis and the API share the `default` network. The API also joins the internal `frontend` network; web joins `frontend` and the web-only `ingress` network that publishes its loopback port. Web therefore has no network path to the database or cache. Do not mark `default` internal: the API needs outbound access.

## Staging

An isolated rootless Docker daemon (`tempo-staging-docker.service`) runs a separate copy of the stack on `http://127.0.0.1:8119/tempo/`. Deploy any API/web pair with one command; an omitted component keeps its current image:

```bash
ops/install.sh staging                         # after changing ops/
tempo-deploy staging --api pr-115 --web main
```

A successful deploy refreshes the staging database from the newest production backup, so staging holds production data: keep it on loopback. See [`staging/README.md`](staging/README.md).
