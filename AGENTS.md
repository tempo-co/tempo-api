# Tempo API Agent Instructions

Tempo API is a NestJS backend for personal-finance accounts, authentication, Enable Banking bank connections, synchronized bank accounts, balances, and transactions, base-currency conversion, and spending categorization. It runs on Node.js 22.x and uses PostgreSQL, Redis/BullMQ, Mailpit, and optional Enable Banking and OpenAI-backed integrations.

## Product direction and workflow

- Tempo is personal-use-first, not a public multi-tenant SaaS. A private self-hosted production deployment exists; do not assume managed cloud services or public SaaS behavior.
- The intended deployment model is a self-hosted 24/7 instance using real bank data fetched through Enable Banking, with access from other devices. Keep that separate from local development and test environments.
- Do not push directly to `main`; use a pull request with passing CI. Use Conventional Commit-style messages such as `feat: ...` and `fix: ...`.
- The adjacent frontend repository is `../tempo-web`; in task descriptions, “frontend” means `tempo-web` and “backend” means this `tempo-api`. For cross-repo work, inspect both repositories and their `AGENTS.md` files.
- CI publishes `ghcr.io/tempo-co/tempo-api:pr-<n>` for every same-repo PR and, after tests pass on `main`, tags that commit's image `:main`, which production deploys. Frontend E2E uses `:main`, or `:pr-<n>` when the web PR body contains `Depends-on: tempo-api#<n>`; coordinate API contract changes with frontend E2E coverage.

## Dev environment

- Prerequisites: Node.js 22.x and Docker Engine 28.0.0 or later. Install the locked dependencies with `npm ci`.
- Development: `npm run start:dev`. This starts `docker-compose.dev.yml` with `.env.development`, then starts Nest in watch mode. The stack includes PostgreSQL, Redis, RedisInsight, Mailpit, and pgAdmin; published development and test ports bind only to host loopback, and pgAdmin requires login.
- Development Swagger is at `http://localhost:3000/docs` when `PORT=3000`.
- Configuration is validated by `src/app/core/config/config.schema.ts`. `NODE_ENV` selects `.env.development`, `.env.test`, or `.env.production`; the corresponding `.local` file takes precedence for Nest configuration.
- `src/app/core/config/config.schema.ts` is the source of truth for required and optional environment variables. Use `.env.development` plus `.env.development.local` for local secrets, and keep credentials out of Git.
- Optional AI categorization configuration is `AI_CATEGORIZATION_ENABLED` (default `false`), `AI_CATEGORIZATION_PROVIDER` (default `openai`), and `AI_CATEGORIZATION_MODEL` (default `gpt-6-luna`). `AI_CATEGORIZATION_WEB_SEARCH_ENABLED` (default `false`) enables the web-search fallback for transactions the standard pass leaves as `OTHER` or `NEEDS_REVIEW`. `OPENAI_API_KEY` is required only when OpenAI categorization is enabled; keep it in the deployment secret/environment path, never in Git.
- Banking configuration: `BANKING_INTEGRATION_ENABLED` (default `true`) gates the Enable Banking integration. When enabled, configure exactly one of `ENABLE_BANKING_PRIVATE_KEY_B64` or `ENABLE_BANKING_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` alongside the other `ENABLE_BANKING_*` values and `BANKING_SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY_B64`. Background sync timing uses `BANKING_SYNC_INTERVAL`, `BANKING_SYNC_DISPATCH_INTERVAL`, and `BANKING_SYNC_RUNNING_TIMEOUT`.

## Build, lint, format, and test

- Build: `npm run build` (clears `dist`, then runs `nest build`).
- CI-equivalent checks: `npm run lint:check` and `npm run format:check`.
- Auto-fixing variants: `npm run lint` and `npm run format` modify files.
- Unit Jest: `npm run test` or `npm run test:cov`.
- E2E Jest: `npm run test:e2e` or `npm run test:e2e:cov`. These first run `npm run docker:test:down`, then `npm run docker:test:up`, clear `dist`, and run `test/jest-e2e.json` serially with `--runInBand`.
- Direct test-container commands are `npm run docker:test:up` and `npm run docker:test:down`.
- Jest unit tests match `src/**/*.spec.ts`; E2E tests match `test/**/*.e2e.spec.ts`. A spec named any other way (for example `*.spec.ts.ts`, or a `test/` file without `.e2e.`) silently never runs. E2E setup creates the Nest app, applies the global validation pipe, and seeds accounts.
- CI runs `npm ci`, lint/format checks, `npm run build`, `npm run test`, and `npm run test:e2e:cov`; coverage is uploaded to Coveralls.

## Test helpers

Reuse these instead of re-creating setup inline:

- `test/setup/e2e.setup.ts`: `getApp()`, `loginAgent(httpServer, email, password)`, `getSessionCookie(response)`, and `enableAiCategorizationE2e()` / `enableAiCategorizationWebSearchE2e()` (call at module scope, before the app boots).
- `test/utils/auth-utils.ts`: `createAccountCredentials()`, `createVerifiedAccount(httpServer, mailpitApiUrl)` (signs up, verifies through Mailpit, returns a logged-in agent), and `expectValidationMessage(response, pattern)` for `ValidationPipe` 400s.
- `test/utils/email-utils.ts`: `EmailUtils.getVerificationCode(recipient, apiUrl)` / `getToken(recipient, apiUrl)` fetch and validate a code or token from Mailpit; `findEmailByRecipient` and the `get*EmailBody` builders check full email content.
- `scripts/seed-data/seed.constants.ts`: seeded accounts. Use the one dedicated to a flow when a test changes account data (`PW_CHANGE`, `PW_RESET`, `EMAIL_CHANGE`, `SESSION_TEST`), not the shared `VERIFIED` account. `UNVERIFIED` covers email-verification cases.
- `scripts/seed-data/banking-fixtures.ts`: `new BankingFixtures(app)` persists connections, bank accounts, sync runs, balances, and transactions with valid defaults, including the derived display description; pass only the fields a test depends on. It also exposes the repositories (`fixtures.transactions`, etc.).
- `scripts/seed-data/seed-banking-data.ts`: `seedBankingData(app, {accountEmail})` seeds the full dev dataset (connection, account, sync run, 2 balances, 13 transactions) for one account. It is also used by `npm run db:seed`, so don't assert on its exact contents in specs that need stable data; build those rows with `BankingFixtures`.
- `test/fixtures/bank-transaction.fixture.ts`: `createBankTransaction(overrides)` is an in-memory `BankTransaction` for unit tests. It lives outside `src/` so it stays out of the build.
- Route authentication (401 unauthenticated, 403 `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED`) is covered once in `test/e2e/auth/auth-guard.e2e.spec.ts`. Add new protected routes to its tables instead of repeating those checks per spec.
- For unit tests of services with many constructor dependencies, follow the named-dependency builders in `banking.service.spec.ts` and `banking-sync.service.spec.ts` rather than positional `{} as never` lists. Use `it.each` tables for validation cases.

## Layout and conventions

- `src/main.ts` bootstraps the app; `src/app.module.ts` imports global infrastructure from `src/app/core` and features from `src/app/modules`.
- Core modules cover config, database, email, health, pagination, queues, rate limiting, Redis, and sessions. Feature modules are `account`, `auth`, and `banking`.
- Feature controllers and most DTOs live under `api/` (or `api/dtos/`); entities and the main feature service live at the feature root. In `banking`, supporting services, processors, and the Enable Banking client live under `services/`, and AI categorization lives under `categorization/` with provider implementations in `categorization/providers/`. Shared banking helpers belong in `banking.utils.ts`.
- Use the observed aliases `@core/*` and `@modules/*` for cross-feature imports; use relative imports inside a feature. The import sorter groups third-party imports, aliases, then relative imports with blank-line separation.
- TypeScript uses tabs, 4-space tab width, single quotes, trailing commas, LF endings, and a 120-column print width. Prettier also sorts imports and specifiers.
- DTOs use `class-validator`; the app applies `ValidationPipe({whitelist: true, transform: true})`. Entities use TypeORM decorators and `class-transformer` `@Expose`/`@Exclude` for response serialization.
- Services use injected TypeORM repositories and Nest HTTP exceptions (`NotFoundException`, `ConflictException`, `UnauthorizedException`, `BadRequestException`, or `UnprocessableEntityException`) for validated failure paths. Account-owned queries include the account ID.
- BullMQ processors handle background work: email delivery, bank connection sync, transaction categorization, and base-currency amount conversion. Add or change queue behavior in the relevant `core/queue` constants/module and feature processor/service together.
- For external integrations, prefer E2E/integration coverage against the local Docker services over mocks.

## Pitfalls

- Test mode configures TypeORM with `dropSchema: true`; E2E setup seeds accounts before tests. `.env.test` must satisfy the full config schema and its host ports must be free. The runtime image ships `.env.test` (synthetic values) because tempo-web E2E runs it with `NODE_ENV=test`; `.env.development` is not in the image.
- `npm run test:e2e*` deliberately removes test containers/volumes via `docker compose ... down -v --remove-orphans`. Do not point `.env.test` at a development database.
- `npm run db:seed` truncates and recreates the PostgreSQL `public` schema before seeding; run it only against the intended database.
- Compose uses fixed container names and environment-interpolated host ports, so stale containers or overlapping ports can block startup.
- `dist/` and `coverage/` are generated. Email `.hbs` files belong under `src/app/core/email/templates`; Nest copies them to `dist/src` via `nest-cli.json`.
